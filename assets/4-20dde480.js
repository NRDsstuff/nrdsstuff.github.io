# typing animation yay
i updated my site in 2 main ways:
- i moved all parts of the website into their own separate module files
- i added a typing animation to the website

yes, i did steal the typing animation from my girlfriend's website but eh who cares

also, the kernel i installed seems to have a steady 12%/h battery draw but it's apparently supposed to get better once i drain it to 10ish% and then charge it to 100% (battery calibration or something)`;export{t as default};

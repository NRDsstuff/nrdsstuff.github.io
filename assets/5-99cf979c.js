# autoscroll
continuing to improve my website, i made it automatically scroll to the bottom as the commands are being executed

my phone's battery is at 49% at 14:17, which wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't for the fact i unplugged my phone at 9:30

ugh i guess i just gotta wait and see how the battery will perform tomorrow`;export{t as default};

# finally online
yesterday, i built this website (based off my girlfriend's personal website), but i couldn't get it to deploy properly until today. 

the issue was github trying to serve the master branch instead of the gh-pages one.

i fixed it after a long few hours of constantly looking for the issue, until i found out it was serving the wrong branch, after which my girlfriend helped me fix that... and now the website's online.

i don't really have anything else interesting to write here so Ã¦

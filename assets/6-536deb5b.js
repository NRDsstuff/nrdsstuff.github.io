at first i was nervous as shit but the second my gf hugged me, all that nervousness faded away
when my gf’s dad was driving us to our hotels, me and my gf spent the whole ride just cuddling in the car
i went to sleep at like 4 am and woke up 4 hours later and instantly went to a nearby park with my gf
my gf can’t resist showering me with affection for like 5 minutes, holy shit, i found gold, i will never replace her
later, we chilled in my apartment, yes, we did spend the whole time cuddling
after that, we went to eat something at a restaurant and then an art exibition with 100 portraits of important romanians (although we were more interested in eachother than the exibition lol)</p>`,d(e,"class","markdown-body")},m(t,i){h(t,e,i)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&m(e)}}}const f={};class c extends r{constructor(e){super(),s(this,e,null,u,o,{})}}export{c as default,f as frontmatter};

# -0 is back
welp not exactly -0 itself but the -0 discord server which i deleted a few months ago. why did i delete it? long story short nobody was active in it and it was too much of a mess to manage in addition to some really old baggage that could let's say hurt the -0 brand.

either way, that's the past and the new server was received pretty well at the time of writing this blog entry with having the greatest spike in activity at the beginning of its existence (for obvious reasons).

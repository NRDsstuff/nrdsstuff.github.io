in the morning, i installed a custom kernel (sultan kernel) for my pixel 7. 

honestly, why is the default battery life so shit? i get about 12-16h with 200-300 cycles of wear...

c'mon google

anyways, today is the last day of school before majówka and the lessons were shortened to the point at which coming to school basically makes no sense

but i still have to go there because uhh yes 👍

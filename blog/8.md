Holding my arms folded molded in bronze
Rodin this golden era with a song
Long gone from it’s formative norms sits the dawn in it’s fawn
Calling a warning that we mourn for the born
Cause of alarm ain't because of these arms here
Because of these arm chairs the comfort that I fear
Could come for my son
What’s our competence done
It compliments none our confidence won
They blaming they like its coming from some
Common denom confidant we the sum of the one
Summit to come ain't a summer with sun
Ain't a number of funds to escape this
Faceless tasteless the invisible and weightless
Wrath of ideas that are divisible by nature shape us
Don’t ask where the cape was
Just ask where that cape canaveral can take us

And they gone

The future came in disproportions
On a shaky circuit heard the verdict they’ve been deserted
Braving the surface gazing from Hayden
Waving from Earth is our daily service
Worst is a coming
Earth is succumbing numb to the purpose of our becoming great
Subservient state awaits its Permian fate mayday hurry escape
The bile projected the piles of wreckage
Is a message to every child at seven miles a second
Is how they left it, decrepit
Exiled rejected x’d out reflected on the red Nile
The dead smiles of skeptics kept it’s vow to protect it’s plutonium Newtonian perspective
Showing theres no new home for men accept it
The smog is brimming our star is dimming
Showing nothing but the far faint shard of living

And they gone

The dewey-eyed they got their mind on right
The nihilists how they wanna dry my sight
The dewey-eyed they got their mind on right
The nihilists how they wanna dry my sight
Say I have no right to fly my kite
Say I have no right to shine my light
So I bind those two to fly by night
And I kill my days to do so

We got our home pillaged by the killers on thrones
Who fought villagers
Drones who sought privilege on the littlest stone
Prideful death left to sift through it’s bones
While we still in the smoke filled biosphere quilting this dome
Filthy rich turned to filthy alone
Only left to atone for the fire here
Die or find a pioneer
Hoping one is breathing
Cus breathing is the only thing admired here

And they gone


The dewey-eyed they got their mind on right
The nihilists how they wanna dry my sight
The dewey-eyed they got their mind on right
The nihilists how they wanna dry my sight
Say I have no right to fly my kite
Say I have no right to shine my light
So I bind those two and fly by night
And I kill my days to do so


o awen lon, o weka tan ike
